## Current Read

- `launcher.hako emit_mir_mainline` is green
- `stage1_mainline_smoke.sh` is green
- `80x` is landed; pointer docs are thin again
- `81x` closed with a no-op archive sweep
- `83x` closed as an explicit keep proof for top-level selfhost wrappers
- `84x` landed after repointing Stage1 build/default entry contracts to canonical `entry/*`
- `85x` selected `86x` as the next structural source lane
- `86x` landed with a thinner phase index/current mirror surface
- `87x` landed after refreshing snapshot-pinned runner paths to canonical `facade/*` and `entry/*`
- `88x` landed as a no-op archive/deletion rerun
- `89x` selected `90x current-doc/design stale surface hygiene`
- `90x` thinned stale wrapper/current wording in current/design docs after the latest recuts
- `91x` froze the top-level `.hako` wrapper policy after the latest runner/selfhost recuts
- `92x` closed the proof/compat caller rerun lane against the canonical wrapper homes
- `93x` moved archive-later engineering helpers into `tools/archive/legacy-selfhost/engineering/`
- current work has handed off to the existing `phase-94` task

## Successor Corridor

1. `phase-94 escape route P5b “完全E2E” のための ch 再代入対応`

## Structural Stop Lines

- `rust-vm`
  - mainline retirement: achieved
  - residual explicit keep: frozen
- `vm-hako`
  - reference/conformance keep
