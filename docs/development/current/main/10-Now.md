- active lane: read `active_lane` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`

## Active Blocker

```text
RUST-SUBSET-SYN-ADAPTER-MULTI-MODULE-PROBE-001
```

The scan-methods focused timeout slice is closed by 296x-1304, the touched
string-corridor regression is closed by 296x-1305, PHI input rematerialization
identity is closed by 296x-1306, and string-corridor stable-length hint fallback
retirement is closed by 296x-1307. The rust-subset app-front smoke reopen is
closed by 296x-1308; `JsonParser.parse_array/0` is owned by
loop_true_break_continue via the recipe-first ExitAllowed path. A dedicated
syn-adapter smoke wrapper is closed by 296x-1309. RustSubset `Index`
expression transport is closed by 296x-1310. Loop `break` / `continue` is
fixture-guarded as an explicit Unsupported handoff by 296x-1311. Generic
function skeleton transport is closed by 296x-1312. Unsupported trait handoff
hardening is closed by 296x-1313. Rust-subset smoke fixture handling is
table-driven by 296x-1314. Crate/multi-file handoff boundaries are inventoried
by 296x-1315; the preferred next contract is manifest plus per-module
`RustSubsetModule` artifacts, but it is not implemented yet. Module schema
validation parity is closed by 296x-1316. RustSubset path/name normalization is
closed by 296x-1317 without adding `.hako` syntax. The crate manifest v0
contract is accepted by 296x-1318. The active crate-skeleton blocker is the
synthetic multi-module syn-adapter probe.

## Next

1. Inspect `apps/rust-subset-to-hako/STATUS.md`.
2. Implement `RUST-SUBSET-SYN-ADAPTER-MULTI-MODULE-PROBE-001` without changing
   converter_core ownership.
4. Keep converter core separate from input routes and crate/file graph
   discovery.
5. Run:

```bash
cargo check -q --lib
bash apps/rust-subset-to-hako/smoke.sh
bash apps/rust-subset-to-hako/smoke_adapter.sh
```

6. Update current pointers when the next slice is chosen.

  - converter prints emitted names and does not resolve Rust paths
- `RUST-SUBSET-CRATE-MANIFEST-V0-001`
  - crate-wide handoff is a manifest plus per-module RustSubsetModule artifacts
  - manifest is a transport index, not a semantic AST or name resolver
  - multi-file adapter output is still a follow-up row

Closeout evidence:

```bash
cargo test -q operand_view
cargo test -q phi_input_materializer
cargo test -q string_corridor_relation
cargo test -q string_corridor_sink
cargo test -q string_kernel_plan
cargo check -q --lib
git diff --check

bash apps/rust-subset-to-hako/smoke_adapter.sh
```

## Paused Lanes

- exact-AOT fastpath optimization is paused until a fresh measured owner
  appears.
- VM product-route app validation is retired; app/selfhost validation uses
  EXE/AOT unless a semantic-reference VM task explicitly opts in.
- build crate split planning is available but not the active blocker.
