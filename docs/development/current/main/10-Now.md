# Self Current Task — Now (main)

## Current

- current implementation lane: `phase163x primitive and user-box fast path`
- sibling guardrail lane: `phase137x main kilo reopen selection`
- immediate next: `generic placement / effect`
- immediate follow-on: `semantic simplification bundle`

## Landing Snapshot

- `phase225x` is landed:
  - optimizer pre/post-DCE placement/effect hooks now run through one generic transform owner seam
  - `phase224x` string helper proof fold stays the first delegated transform under that seam
  - retained and same-block route-window sinks from `phase222x` / `phase223x` remain intact
