# Now

## Current

- current-state SSOT: `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- active lane: read `active_lane` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- active phase: read `active_phase` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- latest card: read `latest_card_path` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- blocker token: read `current_blocker_token` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`

## Active Blocker

```text
VARIABLE-CONTEXT-LIFECYCLE-GAP-INVENTORY-001
```

Read `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml` for the complete active
lane status. BindingContext lifecycle pilot/oracle parity is closed, and
VariableContext gap inventory is selected as the next owner.

The active row is 296x-1390. It inventories VariableContext lifecycle gaps
before any facts/plan pilot starts.

## Next

1. Read 296x-1390.
2. Inventory VariableContext lifecycle gaps only.
3. Select the smallest next VariableContext slice.
4. Keep facts/plan fixture creation out of this row.
5. Keep Rust/Hako code changes, general resolver, and lifecycle parity claims
   disabled.
6. Run:

```bash
git diff --check
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

Closeout evidence:

cargo test -q string_corridor_relation
cargo test -q string_corridor_sink
cargo test -q string_kernel_plan
cargo check -q --lib

```

## Paused Lanes

- exact-AOT fastpath optimization is paused until a fresh measured owner
  appears.
- VM product-route app validation is retired; app/selfhost validation uses
  EXE/AOT unless a semantic-reference VM task explicitly opts in.
- build crate split planning is available but not the active blocker.
