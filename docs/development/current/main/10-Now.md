# Now

## Current

- current-state SSOT: `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- active lane: read `active_lane` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- active phase: read `active_phase` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- latest card: read `latest_card_path` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- blocker token: read `current_blocker_token` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`

## Active Blocker

```text
RUST-SUBSET-NEXT-APP-FRONT-TASK-SELECTION-001
```

The scan-methods focused timeout slice is closed by 296x-1304, the touched
string-corridor regression is closed by 296x-1305, PHI input rematerialization
identity is closed by 296x-1306, and string-corridor stable-length hint fallback
retirement is closed by 296x-1307. The rust-subset app-front smoke reopen is
closed by 296x-1308; `JsonParser.parse_array/0` is owned by
loop_true_break_continue via the recipe-first ExitAllowed path.

## Next

1. Inspect `apps/rust-subset-to-hako/STATUS.md`.
2. Select the next rust-subset-to-hako app-front slice.
3. Keep converter core separate from input routes.
4. Run:

```bash
cargo check -q --lib
bash apps/rust-subset-to-hako/smoke.sh
```

5. Update current pointers when the next slice is chosen.

## Recently Closed

- `STRING-CORRIDOR-SINK-REGRESSION-CLEANUP-001`
  - semantic string-corridor benchmark contract
  - read-only `MethodCallOperandView`
  - no benchmark/source/function-name branches
- `PHI-INPUT-REMAT-OPERAND-MEMO-001`
  - predecessor-local rematerialization memo
  - receiver-prefixed substring remat identity preserved
  - accepted remat shapes unchanged
- `STRING-CORRIDOR-STABLE-LENGTH-HINT-FALLBACK-RETIRE-001`
  - string-corridor planning reads typed stable-length relations
  - diagnostic stable-length hints remain output-only
  - hint parsing as correctness evidence retired
- `RUST-SUBSET-APP-FRONT-LOOP-TRUE-BREAK-CONTINUE-SMOKE-CLOSEOUT-001`
  - `parse_array`-class loop(true) shapes use loop_true_break_continue
  - effectful continue-prelude branches are accepted through ExitAllowed
  - full rust-subset app-front smoke is green

Closeout evidence:

```bash
cargo test -q operand_view
cargo test -q phi_input_materializer
cargo test -q string_corridor_relation
cargo test -q string_corridor_sink
cargo test -q string_kernel_plan
cargo check -q --lib
git diff --check

bash apps/rust-subset-to-hako/smoke.sh
```

## Paused Lanes

- exact-AOT fastpath optimization is paused until a fresh measured owner
  appears.
- VM product-route app validation is retired; app/selfhost validation uses
  EXE/AOT unless a semantic-reference VM task explicitly opts in.
- build crate split planning is available but not the active blocker.
