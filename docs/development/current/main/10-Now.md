# Now

## Current

Read the machine-readable pointer first:

```text
CURRENT_STATE.toml
  -> active_lane / work_mode
  -> current_execution_row / current_blocker_token
  -> latest_workstream_card / latest_card_path
  -> current_design_stop / current_execution_design
```

Current mode is `fast`. The parser public-AST/postpass, V2 schema, typed
callable syntax carriage, and old instance-result/target design audit are
closed. The selected bounded implementation is:

```text
SOURCE-INSTANCE-RESULT-CONTRACT-RETIRE0-I0
```

This I0 deletes the audited caller-zero body-inferred instance-result/target
family and preserves only neutral source-view primitives. The landed syntax
slice carried parser-owned `CallableContract(query)` syntax into a typed DTO
and rich source seal only. Resolver declaration/signature, Home ABI, instance
targets, source-bound CallSlot relations, ScanWithInit, physical lowering,
production selection, and legacy retirement remain unopened.

The explicit LoopRecipe V2 wire (`I64|Bool|Unit|Text`, local `CallSlot`, and
`TextEq`) is implemented and its seven-test focused closeout is green. No
fallback or source/physical shortcut is allowed.

## Restart

```bash
git status -sb
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

Read the active card and workstream named by `CURRENT_STATE.toml`. Do not use
historical loop chronology in this mirror to select S6C, M9, or production
cutover. The ordered path remains:

```text
typed syntax carriage (closed)
-> old instance-result/target retirement (active bounded I0)
-> declaration / Home ABI / target / source-bound relation
-> S6C ScanWithInit
-> M9 parity
-> M10 semantic co-seal and transfer authority
-> production selection / M10b
-> M11/M12 retirement
```

## Rule

This file is only a mirror. Implementation details, acceptance, landed
history, and parked tasks belong in the active card, workstream SSOT, phase
cards, or git history.
