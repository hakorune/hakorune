# BoundedBodyAnalysisSnapshotV0

Status: Parked design/implementation task; starts after the LocalContractWrite
Fact bridge.
Date: 2026-07-12

## Decision

Create one shared Hako analysis capability before migrating another Fact
facade. It is not a full AST owner and does not move planner authority.

```text
validated Program(JSON v0) body
-> BoundedBodyAnalysisSnapshotV0
-> read-only Fact facade
```

The frontend AST remains language semantic authority. Program(JSON v0) is the
validated transport boundary, not a second language SSOT.

## V0 schema boundary

Required envelope:

```text
schema_version
source_program_version
body
node_count
max_depth_observed
```

Closed statement subset:

```text
Local, Assignment, CompoundAssignment, Print, If, Loop, LoopRange,
Return, Break, Continue
```

Closed expression subset:

```text
Literal, Variable, UnaryOp, BinaryOp, GroupedAssignmentExpr, MethodCall,
FunctionCall, FieldAccess, Index
```

V0 excludes Lambda, Try/Catch/Throw, Task/Await, Match, ContextScope, FastMem,
declarations, general BlockExpr, QMark, and unknown future nodes.

## Three-way outcome

```text
Ready(snapshot)
Unsupported(path, node_kind, reason)
InvalidInput(path, reason)
```

Unsupported shape must never be collapsed into “no Fact”. Limits for depth,
node count, children, arguments, and literal bytes are fixed by the schema;
partial snapshots and consumer-specific limits are forbidden.

## Analysis-only API

Consumers may inspect node kind, child role/index, literal, name, operator,
body items, and diagnostic source path. They may not mutate nodes, resolve
symbols, infer types, emit MIR, allocate IDs, select routes, build Plans, or
execute runtime behavior.

## Acceptance

1. Rust canonical-AST traversal and Hako Program(JSON v0) traversal are
   independent implementations.
2. Snapshot parity is green before Fact parity is attempted.
3. Negative corpus covers quoted JSON-looking strings, escaped delimiters,
   nested If/Loop, missing/wrong fields, unknown nodes, depth/node limits, and
   unsupported Try/Lambda/Match.
4. No raw substring, token offset, or `indexOf` result reaches a Fact consumer.
5. No fallback from Unsupported to the token-only semantic facade.

## Non-claims

```text
full_ast_support = 0
fact_authority_moved = 0
planner_input = 0
route_selection_authority = 0
backend_lowering_authority = 0
mir_mutation = 0
id_allocation = 0
source_selfhost_claim = 0
```

## Stop boundary

Stop if the snapshot requires language-semantic inference, ValueId/BlockId
allocation, or a second raw-token semantic path.
