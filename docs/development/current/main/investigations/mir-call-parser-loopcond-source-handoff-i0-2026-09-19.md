# Parser LoopCond source handoff I0

## Six-line brief

```text
Decision: admit one parser-branded nested/exit-driven LoopCond source product
through the existing Facts/Recipe/JoinSig/physical pipeline and switch the
selected ParserProgramBox.parse/2 -> starts_with/3 row through that product.
Source authority + canonical issuer: same-invocation merged source plus the
resolver-issued loop forest and ResolvedExitRecordV1 set; the existing source
Facts issuer is extended as the sole co-seal owner.
Non-authority: AST/name/arity matching, parser line lookup, MIR scans,
LoopBreak legacy route, GenericLoop fallback, VM compatibility, and retries.
Fail-fast boundary: any owner/forest/path/exit/target/result drift rejects before
catalog or argument effects; no partial LoopCond physical session is retained.
Smallest next slice: source co-seal, LoopCond route token, source-port physical
consume, focused matrix, then delete only this tuple's retained old edge.
Non-claims: other parser loops/calls, expression-If PHI, VM/AOT parity, whole
R7 retirement, Windows evidence, or whole-library green.
```

## Exact acceptance tuple

```text
caller       = ParserProgramBox.parse/2
target       = ParserStringUtilsBox.starts_with/3
target site  = resolver-issued source site for parser_program_box.hako:102
route        = LoopCondBreakContinue (exactly one raw execution route)
forest       = root :81 plus children :131 and :182, parent-linked in order
exits        = all resolver rows for the three members, including :85/:95,
               :104/:109/:127/:142/:161/:165/:194 returns, :186 continue,
               and :188 break; :218 is outside the root loop
result       = ExactI64, required ordinal `[1]`
```

The line numbers are the reviewed finite source shape, not lookup keys. The
co-seal must carry `SourceNodeSiteV1`/frame/path identity from the resolver and
the target relation from the same invocation. No later owner may recreate a
site from a Hako line, method name, arity, or MIR.

## Existing owners and permitted edits

```text
resolved source forest/exits
  -> existing normal callable source Facts issuer (split before 760 lines if needed)
  -> LoopCondBreakContinue Facts/Recipe + one-shot route token
  -> existing loop_cond_bc physical pipeline through CallableLoopSourceExpressionPortV1
  -> existing completion/DraftSeal
  -> StaticResultPublicationIngressPortV1 and statement-If/Equal consumer
```

Permitted edits are limited to the existing owners:

- `src/mir/builder/control_flow/facts/loop_cond_break_continue.rs`
- `src/mir/builder/control_flow/recipes/loop_cond_break_continue.rs`
- `src/mir/builder/control_flow/plan/features/loop_cond_bc.rs` and its existing
  split helpers
- `src/mir/builder/control_flow/joinir/route_entry/registry/selection.rs`
- the existing callable source Facts/port modules and their focused tests

The source physical path may not construct a `LoopRouteContext`, invoke the
legacy normalizer, or re-enter route classification. If a touched file would
cross 760 lines, split at the responsibility boundary before adding behavior;
800 lines is a hard stop.

## Progress checkpoint — source forest co-seal

The first implementation step is landed in the existing compiler projection and
neutral structural-facts owner. `issue_loop_cond_break_continue_source_forest_projection_v1`
consumes the resolver's complete nested forest, binds its ordered parent
relations through `VerifiedLoopSourceForestBindingV1`, and retains every
resolver exit under the selected root as a paired source-site/transfer row.
The focused fixture proves a three-member forest with parent indices
`[None, Some(0), Some(0)]` and four nested exits. No route, Recipe, Builder,
MIR, or physical identity is issued by this step; the product remains
caller-zero until the source Facts issuer consumes it.

Evidence: `forest_projection_seals_nested_members_and_all_root_exits` plus the
five existing single-loop projection tests pass under the focused quick
library filter. The remaining I0 work is the source Facts/Recipe handoff and
physical/static consumer path below; this checkpoint does not retire the old
edge or claim source-to-MIR acceptance.

## Design audit checkpoint — typed NoSafeSlice

The read-only bridge audit closed the next boundary as `NoSafeSlice`; no code
or fixture change is authorized until this contract is designed in the
existing owners. `CallableGenericLoopSourceFactsIssuerV1` is the only current
source Facts issuer, but it accepts only the GenericLoop payload and emits
`GenericLoopV1` selection. The local `LoopCondBreakContinueFacts`/Recipe can
express nested AST shapes, yet its `StmtRef` exit items do not retain the
resolver `ResolvedExitRecordV1` rows or the forest parent binding. The existing
LoopCond composer/physicalizer also requires `LoopRouteContext` and re-enters
AST/legacy lowering; the source GenericLoop expression port cannot safely
consume it.

This is an internal authority gap, not an external wait. The reopen contract
is one same-owner co-seal that carries the forest binding, all paired exit
records, the selected source target relation, and a source-aware LoopCond
Recipe/JoinSig handoff into a physical adapter that does not construct
`LoopRouteContext`. Until that product and consumer are specified, retain the
selected compatibility edge and do not issue a route token, catalog row,
fallback, or production switch. Evidence: read-only audit of
`normal_callable_loop_source_facts.rs`,
`control_flow/facts/loop_cond_break_continue.rs`,
`control_flow/recipes/loop_cond_break_continue.rs`,
`plan/recipe_tree/loop_cond_composer.rs`, and
`plan/features/loop_cond_bc.rs` on 2026-09-19.

## Ordered implementation tasks

| Order | Task | Completion condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Source co-seal | One move-only product binds the exact three-member forest, ordered paths/frame keys, all resolver exits, parser brand/owner, and target/source site. Foreign, missing, duplicate, or orphan rows reject before effects. |
| 2 | LoopCond route token | **Blocked by NoSafeSlice.** First design the same-owner source Facts/Recipe/JoinSig product; then the route registry must yield exactly `[LoopCondBreakContinue]` for this product, with GenericLoop, LoopBreak, overlap, and route re-entry as typed rejects. |
| 3 | Source physical consume | **Blocked by NoSafeSlice.** `loop_cond_bc` needs a source-aware adapter that lowers nested recipe items and exit transfers without constructing `LoopRouteContext`, and discards the whole session on error. |
| 4 | Static tuple handoff | The selected static result reaches the existing statement-If/Equal consumer with ordered arguments and ExactI64 result; duplicate consume and wrong ordinal reject before argument effects. |
| 5 | Negative matrix | Wrong owner/brand, forest parent drift, omitted child, wrong path, missing/duplicate/foreign exit, wrong target/header/result, legacy route re-entry, and extra nested loop all fail closed. |
| 6 | Retirement and acceptance | After positive plus negative evidence, remove only the selected tuple's retained compatibility/static-child disposition and record source-to-MIR acceptance. |

## Focused validation

Use one `cargo test --profile quick --lib` process with at most four build jobs
and exact filters for the new source handoff, route selection, physical
consume, and static tuple lifecycle. Add structural guards for no
`LoopRouteContext`/legacy fallback on the source path, no AST/name remap, and
the selected old edge reaching zero. Existing baseline reds remain separately
classified; they do not widen this row.

No Windows or whole-library run is required for this I0. The parent static
card owns the later phase14/16/17 source-to-exe closeout; this card must first
prove the selected source-to-MIR handoff and its old-edge deletion.
