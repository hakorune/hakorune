# MirBuilder warning baseline refresh I34

## Six-line brief

```text
Decision: refresh both warning surfaces after the I33 normal-root reject
  test facade cohort before selecting another cleanup row.
Source authority + canonical issuer: fixed quick-profile Cargo diagnostics and
  the checked-in warning classification policy.
Non-authority: historical counts, cargo-fix, blanket allow, visibility edits,
  dead-code guesses, or semantic interpretation of lint output.
Fail-fast boundary: command drift, new failure name, unclassified test-only
  reference, or a warning family outside the inventory stops selection.
Smallest next slice: compare current lib/lib-test inventories against
  1,797/561 and select at most one caller-zero import cohort.
Non-claims: no broad warning deletion, suppression, semantic refactor, or
  production route change.
```

## Acceptance

Run `cargo check --profile quick --lib -j4` and
`cargo test --profile quick --lib --no-run -j4` once each. Record lint,
file:line, owner, and production/test/compat/generated role, then select one
cohort or write `NoSafeSlice`. Keep dead-code/private-interface rows with
their owners. No code edit is permitted until the selection is recorded.
