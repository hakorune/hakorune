# Map lifecycle consumer I0

## Six-line brief

```text
Decision: pending — the merged route now stops at
[callable-semantic-package/install] MapLifecycleConsumerMissing; census
which Map lifecycle consumer the install stage requires and which merged
declaration fails to provide it.
Source authority + canonical issuer: pending census of the install
issuer (normal_callable_semantic_package install path).
Non-authority: pending.
Fail-fast boundary: pending.
Smallest next slice: name the issuer, the required consumer row, and the
failing merged declaration; then bound the fix.
Non-claims: production caller switch, physicalization, legacy retirement.
```

`Census boundary: merged entry program -> callable-semantic-package
install stage; pending first investigation.`

## Entry contract

The previous card normalized 15 malformed `birth ... return 0` corpus
sites to `return void` (the accepted Unit contract — `Unit Birth has no
result`). The merged route advanced past
`OrdinaryNew/BirthCompletionNotUnit` and now stops at
`MapLifecycleConsumerMissing` during package install.

## Acceptance

Pending: the merged entry advances past the install-stage
MapLifecycleConsumerMissing to the next named terminal.

## Entry investigation (2026-09-15)

Issuer: `install_map_preflight.rs` — `preflight_map_install` runs at
package install, before catalog mutation.

Arm analysis (`map_install_owners`, ordinary_new_terminal_access.rs):

- `requires_map_lifecycle_consumer` is true in the merged route: 40
  `new MapBox()` initializers produce map rows in completion root_flow
  (no `{k:v}` MapLiteral syntax exists in merged — every `{` is inside
  JSON string literals; MapLiteral preflight loop is vacuous).
- `map_install_owners` then requires `app_main_identity.is_some()` —
  the merged route is a library compile without an AppMain anchor, so
  the check fails closed at `Err(())` -> `MapLifecycleConsumerMissing`.
  (Owners-vs-root and per-owner initializer-chain arms sit behind this.)

Census boundary: merged entry program -> `new MapBox()` initializers;
includes every resolved body; result 40 sites across ~10 functions
(result/m/def/info/m/v locals in parser/emit boxes).

Open design question for the Decision: the Map lifecycle consumer
contract is AppMain-scoped today. The merged route needs either (a) an
explicit non-AppMain map-lifecycle admission row, or (b) the consumer
contract extended to the merged batch's actual root identity — never a
silent bypass of `app_main_identity`.

## External design consultation (2026-09-15, ChatGPT Pro review of 7618c185)

**Recommendation: (b) generalized per-function-owner lifecycle contract.**
The missing piece is not owner identity — every function already carries
`FunctionOwnerIdV1` + completion + root_flow. What is missing is the
contract that the physical route undertakes that function's lifecycle.
The batch must NOT become the runtime Map owner: 899 compiled functions
are not 899 simultaneously-live ownership scopes.

Responsibility split:

| unit            | responsibility                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| each callable   | own Homes, normal/Fault cleanup, arg/result transfer  |
| batch/package   | complete callable-to-consumer correspondence          |
| execution entry | Fault frame start/end, final report, process exit     |

Removing the AppMain condition alone does not finish the work —
downstream keeps the same assumption:

- install checks the AppMain direct-call loan structure and fixed
  i64 call counts (install_map_preflight.rs)
- backend admission requires a retained root and collects its direct
  calls (lifecycle_admission.rs)
- the C consumer requires `functions[0]` as process root
  (hako_llvmc_ffi_published_lifecycle_physical_v2.inc)

Ordinary callables already have the borrowed-Fault-frame + result-output
+ status ABI; emit functions from the sealed callable set and bind a
process adapter only for products that need an execution entry.

Minimum sealed facts (not five new wrappers): identity, complete target
scope, exit+cleanup order, boundary transfer, physical consumer.
`prepare_install` atomicity (return package on failure, stop before
catalog mutation) must be preserved.

Pitfalls named: static-owner vs runtime-scope confusion, mid-transfer
Fault, cleanup order derived from batch order, GC-root confusion.

Pre-production concerns to fix before the source-result issuer connects
to a production caller (review-verified, taskified below):

1. source-admission witness is attached after SourcePlan, not consumed
   as an admission condition — missing/foreign lineage does not reject
   pre-package (normal_callable.rs, A3 tests pass without witness).
2. source-result issuer correspondence verification relies on arg
   name/count; a different declaration's resolved input with the same
   arg shape could seal a wrong-source result — needs direct
   declaration↔resolved-owner identity binding. Test-only today.
3. the same issuer treats every BlockExpr as a transparent tail
   wrapper; a nested block with preprocessing (rebinding then tail
   read) could seal a stale value class — smallest fix is rejecting
   blocks with preprocessing until the bounded family needs them.
4. `: void` functions mixing `return null` (Value) and `return void`
   (Void) fail set-uniformity — the language contract allows both;
   handling must be unified at the declared-result boundary.

Suggested next completion unit: compile two small non-AppMain functions
through the same consumer and verify normal+Fault cleanup on actual
calls; classify the 40 `new MapBox()` sites into local-only / returned /
stored / arg-transferred in parallel. "Advanced to the next terminal"
does not count as consumer completion.

## Decision (accepted 2026-09-15)

**Option (b): generalize to a per-`FunctionOwnerIdV1` lifecycle-undertaking
contract.** The missing piece is the contract that the physical route
undertakes each function's lifecycle — every owner already carries
completion + root_flow + terminal relation + claims. The batch must never
become the runtime Map owner. Option (a) survives only as the
implementation scope (first non-AppMain application of the shared
contract); pseudo-AppMain (c) is rejected.

Caveat from worker verification: `/tmp/merged_entry.hako` DOES contain
`static box Main { main() }` (L19038), so `app_main_identity` is likely
`Some` and the actual failing arm is probably the loan/target/owner
mismatch (install_map_preflight.rs:31-62) or the no-loan
owners-vs-root arm — pin the exact arm first when card 5 starts.

## Ordered bounded card queue

| #  | Card                                                              | Depends |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| C1 | source-result issuer owner binding (`input.owner() == owner`)      | —       |
| C2 | source-admission witness: consume as admission condition or drop   | —       |
| C3 | BlockExpr prelude accounting (reject non-empty prelude or fold)    | —       |
| C4 | `:void` mixed `return null`/`return void` — needs decision record  | —       |
| C5 | per-function lifecycle-undertaking contract (this card's core)     | pin arm |
| C6 | downstream contract split (admit_lifecycle, physical doc, C v2)    | C5      |
| C7 | merged `new MapBox()` census — 39 sites into local/returned/stored/arg | —   |
| C8 | two-function non-AppMain consumer acceptance (normal+Fault cleanup)| C5, C6  |

C1–C4 are pre-production fixes on test-only issuers — cheap and
independent. C5 is this card's core; C6/C8 follow it; C7 informs scope.
Full worker verification evidence lives in the card audit trail.

## Arm pinning (2026-09-15, verified against 7618c185)

`app_main_identity` IS `Some` on the merged route (`static box Main` at
merged L19038 produces the app relation). The actual failing arm is the
**first loop** of `preflight_map_install`: every `MapLiteral` body-shape
site needs `map_flow(&owned)` -> a `Complete` row in that owner's
`root_flow().maps()`. But `observe_map` is reached only through the
Local-initializer walk (`home_new_prefix.rs:678-709`); a `%{...}` in
`return`-position is never observed, so `map_flow` fails
`map-source-unavailable` -> `MapLifecycleConsumerMissing`.

Root cause chain (each layer independently bounded):

1. **Facts**: `flow.maps()` rows are issued only for `local x = %{...}`
   initializer sites — `return %{...}` / arg-position map literals have
   no row at all (`map_source_outward` pins `[Body, Initializer]`).
2. **Facts**: `TerminalRelationV1` has only Call/I64Add/Unit/
   IntegerLiteral/I64Field — `return <local-or-map>` gets
   `ReturnValueNotCovered`, no relation.
3. **Contract**: `map_install_owners` requires map owners be inside the
   AppMain direct-call loan targets (<=5); merged map owners are deep
   ordinary functions.
4. **Physical**: Map return/argument ABI does not exist (checked Map is
   alloca-local; v4 emit supports create/limited entry write/end only).

## Census (merged entry)

`%{...}` MapLiteral: 31 live sites, dominant form `return %{...}`
(MirJsonEmitBox `make_*`/`to_json` family). `new MapBox()`: 39 sites —
27 returned, 10 nested-stored into a returned map, ~6 arg/array
transferred, 1-2 truly local (`seen` dedup). Boundary: merged entry
program -> `%{` literals and `new MapBox()` in function bodies; excludes
string literals/comments.

## Decomposed slice order

- **F1** `MIR-CALL-MAP-RETURN-SITE-FLOW-I0`: observe return-position
  MapLiteral as a map-flow row with a ReturnBoundary destination (Facts).
- **C5** (this card's contract core): per-owner lifecycle undertaking —
  generalize `map_install_owners`/preflight from AppMain-loan membership
  to per-`FunctionOwnerIdV1` verification.
- **F3**: `TerminalRelationV1` extension for non-i64 value returns.
- **F4**: Map return/argument physical ABI (family-scale).
- **C8**: two-function non-AppMain consumer acceptance.

The merged route cannot pass `MapLifecycleConsumerMissing` until F1+F3+F4
land — the map-owning cohort pervasively returns maps. This card's
deliverable is the verified decomposition; C5 remains the contract work.
