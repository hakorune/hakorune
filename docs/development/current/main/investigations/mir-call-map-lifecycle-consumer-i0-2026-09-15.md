# Map lifecycle consumer I0

## Six-line brief

```text
Decision: pending — the merged route now stops at
[callable-semantic-package/install] MapLifecycleConsumerMissing; census
which Map lifecycle consumer the install stage requires and which merged
declaration fails to provide it.
Source authority + canonical issuer: pending census of the install
issuer (normal_callable_semantic_package install path).
Non-authority: pending.
Fail-fast boundary: pending.
Smallest next slice: name the issuer, the required consumer row, and the
failing merged declaration; then bound the fix.
Non-claims: production caller switch, physicalization, legacy retirement.
```

`Census boundary: merged entry program -> callable-semantic-package
install stage; pending first investigation.`

## Entry contract

The previous card normalized 15 malformed `birth ... return 0` corpus
sites to `return void` (the accepted Unit contract — `Unit Birth has no
result`). The merged route advanced past
`OrdinaryNew/BirthCompletionNotUnit` and now stops at
`MapLifecycleConsumerMissing` during package install.

## Acceptance

Pending: the merged entry advances past the install-stage
MapLifecycleConsumerMissing to the next named terminal.

## Entry investigation (2026-09-15)

Issuer: `install_map_preflight.rs` — `preflight_map_install` runs at
package install, before catalog mutation.

Arm analysis (`map_install_owners`, ordinary_new_terminal_access.rs):

- `requires_map_lifecycle_consumer` is true in the merged route: 40
  `new MapBox()` initializers produce map rows in completion root_flow
  (no `{k:v}` MapLiteral syntax exists in merged — every `{` is inside
  JSON string literals; MapLiteral preflight loop is vacuous).
- `map_install_owners` then requires `app_main_identity.is_some()` —
  the merged route is a library compile without an AppMain anchor, so
  the check fails closed at `Err(())` -> `MapLifecycleConsumerMissing`.
  (Owners-vs-root and per-owner initializer-chain arms sit behind this.)

Census boundary: merged entry program -> `new MapBox()` initializers;
includes every resolved body; result 40 sites across ~10 functions
(result/m/def/info/m/v locals in parser/emit boxes).

Open design question for the Decision: the Map lifecycle consumer
contract is AppMain-scoped today. The merged route needs either (a) an
explicit non-AppMain map-lifecycle admission row, or (b) the consumer
contract extended to the merged batch's actual root identity — never a
silent bypass of `app_main_identity`.
