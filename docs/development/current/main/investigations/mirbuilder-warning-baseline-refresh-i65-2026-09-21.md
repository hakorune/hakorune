# MirBuilder warning baseline refresh I65

## Six-line brief

```text
Decision: refresh both warning surfaces after the Raw profile facade-import
  deletion before selecting another cleanup row.
Source authority + canonical issuer: fixed quick-profile Cargo diagnostics and
  the checked-in warning classification policy.
Non-authority: historical counts, cargo-fix, blanket allow, visibility edits,
  dead-code guesses, or semantic interpretation of lint output.
Fail-fast boundary: command drift, new failure name, unclassified test-only
  reference, or a warning family outside the inventory stops selection.
Smallest next slice: compare current lib/lib-test inventories against
  1,754/560 and select at most one caller-zero import cohort.
Non-claims: no broad warning deletion, suppression, semantic refactor, or
  production route change.
```

## Acceptance

Run these commands once each, sequentially, and record warning lint, file and
line, owner, and production/test/compat/generated role:

```text
cargo check --profile quick --lib -j4
cargo test --profile quick --lib --no-run -j4
```

Select one finite caller-zero import cohort or write `NoSafeSlice`. Keep
dead-code and private-interface rows with their owners. No code edit is
permitted until the selection is recorded and the pointer enters its bounded
successor. The current fixed baseline is lib **1,754** and lib-test **560**.
