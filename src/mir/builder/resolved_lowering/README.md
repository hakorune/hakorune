# Resolved lowering boundary

This directory owns the first production consumer of a sealed semantic owner.

Allowed inputs are only `CanonicalFirstFamilyPlanV1` values produced by the
whole-unit compiler preflight. Recursive lowering accepts sealed located-node
carriers and resolves lexical identity through exact source sites.

Invariants:

- `BindingRefV1 -> ValueId` is the canonical value environment.
- names are diagnostic cross-checks, never lookup keys.
- legacy `allocate_binding_id()` is structurally vetoed while an owner is installed.
- declarations, variable uses, assignment targets, and exits must all finish
  source coverage before the function draft can be published.
- canonical lowering seeds separate RegionId and ScopeId stacks from the sealed
  function/function-body roots; BlockExpr consumes one exact pair and retires
  only pair-owned BindingRefs at scope leave.
- I1b consumes one pre-Builder verified statement-If flow in source preorder.
  Both branches start from the same post-condition BindingRef baseline; the
  sealed join-source matrix selects final PHI inputs, and all PHIs define
  before one effect-authorized batch publication.
- RegionId and ScopeId stacks remain separate. Statement If consumes exact
  control/branch identities and coverage only; no durable RegionId-to-block
  map is published before SA4.
- legacy statement/expression dispatch, Planner/CorePlan, Lambda, production
  Loop activation, Main, REPL, and ProgramV0 are outside this boundary.

## Canonical V2 function finish

The three canonical V2 profile lowerers (`trivial_ssa`, `direct_accum`, and
`nested_predicate`) share one consuming finish terminal:

```text
CanonicalSsaFunctionSessionV2::finish_for_draft_seal
  -> ReadyFunctionDraftSealV1
```

Each profile closes its private effect/After/final-carrier ledger into one
move-only `ReadyCanonicalProfileCloseV1`. The common terminal consumes that
receipt and closes CFG, semantic/If control, identity/Binding SSA, PHI, the
resolved binding ledger, and Completion exactly once. It is the sole V2 issuer
of `ReadyFunctionDraftSealV1`.

The terminal accepts no raw body/site/end/target/current-block facts for
re-inference. Those identities are sealed when the exact resolved function
session opens; the profile receipt carries the already-claimed terminal
witness. A failed or duplicate close rejects before publication, and any late
failure discards the whole unpublished function. `PhiTxn` rollback is only
best-effort local cleanup; the outer function session owns atomic discard.

The existing non-V2 direct constructor caller is an explicit compatibility
allowlist entry. It may not gain callers and is retired by a later bounded row;
it is not part of the V2 finish migration. Focused guards must keep V2 direct
`ReadyFunctionDraftSealV1::new` callers at zero and keep all source files below
the repository's 800-line boundary. Every implementation slice updates this
README, the owning reference, and current-entry mirrors in the same commit.

Implementation receipt (`6bf3dd6b35`, 2026-08-07): the three V2 lowerers now
use the consuming terminal, including the previously missing DirectAccum CFG
finish. The one non-V2 constructor remains an explicit, non-growing
compatibility debt. The focused session, resolved-lowering, and draft tests,
the canonical finish guard, and the current-state pointer guard are green;
physical Loop lowering and production selection remain closed at the next
design stop.

## Caller-zero Loop physical prepare

`src/mir/compiler/loop_physical_prepare.rs` is a test-only pre-effect contract
boundary for `LOOP-PHYSICAL-PREPARE-P0`. It brands the exact resolved callable
input, derives a prelude target/result capability from the existing callable
index/header, and seals one Tail/ABI/Completion compatibility relation before
any Builder session opens. The moved `VerifiedLoopPhysicalDemandV1` owns the
co-sealed logical product; the retained resolved input remains a borrowed view.

The current `helper.to_i64(n)` MethodCall fixture intentionally has no
resolver-issued direct callable target and therefore rejects with typed
`NoSafeSlice::MissingPreludeTarget`. A test-only positive source substitution
or a new static-call fixture must never be treated as production resolution;
receiver, target, arity, and result ABI must come from one exact catalog/header
relation. No name lookup, AST rematch, physical ID, Builder effect, selector,
retry, fallback, or production caller is opened by this row.

## Disconnected canonical CFG prerequisite

`canonical_cfg/` owns the SSA-C1 edge/seal substrate. It emits a terminator and
its cached predecessor witness as one fallible operation, derives predecessor
truth directly from terminators, and rejects late edges or cache drift without
calling CFG repair. During SSA-C1 it has zero production If, Loop, and Binding
SSA callers; the existing A+ If path remains unchanged.
