# CURRENT_TASK

Status: SSOT pointer
Date: 2026-06-20
Scope: root restart anchor only. Do not store landed history here.

## Quick Restart

1. Read `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
2. Read the `latest_card_path` named in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
3. Check the worktree:

```bash
git status -sb
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

4. Run heavier gates only when the current code slice is ready:

```bash
tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick
```

## Current Task

Read these fields in `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`:

- `active_lane`
- `active_phase`
- `latest_card_path`
- `current_blocker_token`

Current blocker:

```text
CREAT-SUBSET-PILOT-SELECTION-001
```

Purpose:

```text
Select the first creat-style RustSubset pilot slice after closing the
constructor lifecycle and imported field-initializer route blockers.
```

Acceptance for the current slice:

```bash
cargo check -q --lib
git diff --check
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
# plus the focused inventory/adapter command selected by
# CREAT-SUBSET-PILOT-SELECTION-001
```

## Task Order

1. Inventory candidate creat/source modules without adding new `.hako` syntax.
2. Count unsupported RustSubset families and graph blockers.
3. Select a 2-3 module pilot slice.
4. Keep Rust parser/crate graph discovery in the external adapter boundary.
5. Do not reopen fastpath or constructor lifecycle work without a new blocker.
