# CURRENT_TASK

Status: SSOT pointer
Date: 2026-06-20
Scope: root restart anchor only. Do not store landed history here.

## Quick Restart

1. Read `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
2. Read the `latest_card_path` named in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
3. Check the worktree:

```bash
git status -sb
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

4. Run heavier gates only when the current code slice is ready:

```bash
tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick
```

## Current Task

Read these fields in `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`:

- `active_lane`
- `active_phase`
- `latest_card_path`
- `current_blocker_token`

Current blocker:

```text
IMPORTED-STATIC-GLOBAL-CALLEE-ROUTE-PROBE-001
```

Purpose:

```text
Determine why local app-library static factories such as
FieldInitRouteLib.createDefault/0 are classified as unknown_global_callee while
existing imported library factories such as OrderedMap.create/0 resolve to a
direct function route.
```

```

Acceptance for the current slice:

```bash
bash apps/field_initializer_route_probe/smoke.sh
git diff --check
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
# plus the focused MIR route comparison selected by
# IMPORTED-STATIC-GLOBAL-CALLEE-ROUTE-PROBE-001
```

## Task Order

1. Compare route metadata for `FieldInitRouteLib.createDefault/0` and
   `OrderedMap.create/0`.
2. Identify the owner of imported static/global callee classification.
3. Add the smallest focused fixture or guard for the route seam.
4. Do not change field-initializer semantics in this row.
5. Return to `CREAT-SUBSET-PILOT-SELECTION-001` only after the route seam is
   classified or fixed.

Recommended next row:

```text
IMPORTED-STATIC-GLOBAL-CALLEE-ROUTE-PROBE-001
```
