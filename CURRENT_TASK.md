# CURRENT_TASK (root pointer)

Status: SSOT
Date: 2026-04-25
Scope: current lane / next lane / restart order only.

## Purpose

- root から active lane / next lane に最短で戻る
- landed history と rejected history は phase docs / investigations を正本にする
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` 自体は ledger にしない

## Current Docs Policy

- Current-state SSOT: `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- Update policy SSOT:
  `docs/development/current/main/design/current-docs-update-policy-ssot.md`
- Normal card work must not append landed history here.
- Per-card updates are limited to `CURRENT_STATE.toml` latest-card fields and
  the active card unless lane / blocker / restart order / durable policy changes.

## Quick Restart Pointer

1. `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`
2. `docs/development/current/main/05-Restart-Quick-Resume.md`
3. `docs/development/current/main/10-Now.md`
4. Read `active_phase`, `phase_status`, `method_anchor`, `taskboard`, and
   `latest_card_path` from `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
5. `git status -sb`
6. `bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh`
7. `tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick` when a code slice is ready
8. `docs/development/current/main/phases/phase-29bq/29bq-90-selfhost-checklist.md`
   only when returning to phase-29bq

## Current Lane

- active lane: `phase-291x CoreBox surface contract cleanup`
- active phase: read `active_phase` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- latest card: read `latest_card_path` in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`
- current blocker token: `phase-291x remaining inc mirror cleanup selection pending`
- primary mode: compiler cleanup lane
- phase-137x: observe-only unless app work reopens a real blocker

## Restart Handoff

- last landed: `291x-246` push route mirror prune review completed with no safe prune
- then landed: `291x-245` len route mirror prune review completed with no safe prune
- worktree: current slice includes the 291x-240..246 cleanup/review batch plus
  this restart handoff refresh; next restart should treat that batch as the
  active local diff set
- branch: `public-main` is ahead of remote by 113 commits
- resume point: select the next remaining `.inc` mirror cleanup from the
  phase-291x inventory after the len/push review batch
- restart checks: `git status -sb` -> `bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh` ->
  `tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick` when the next slice is ready

## Next

- select the next remaining `.inc` mirror cleanup from the phase-291x inventory
- keep legacy `push` mirror rows until metadata-absent mutating boundary coverage exists
- keep generic `set` emit-kind and MapBox/RuntimeData storage-route fallback
  rows until their own fallback contracts are replaced
- keep BoxShape cleanup separate from BoxCount feature rows
- keep Stage-B adapter thinning separate from CoreMethodContract migration
- do not add hot inline lowering without proof/evidence gate
- do not reopen landed CoreBox router rows without an owner-path change
