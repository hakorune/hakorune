# CURRENT_TASK

Status: SSOT pointer
Date: 2026-06-20
Scope: root restart anchor only. Do not store landed history here.

## Quick Restart

1. Read `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
2. Read the `latest_card_path` named in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
3. Check the worktree:

```bash
git status -sb
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

4. Run heavier gates only when the current code slice is ready:

```bash
tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick
```

## Current Task

Read these fields in `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`:

- `active_lane`
- `active_phase`
- `latest_card_path`
- `current_blocker_token`

Current blocker:

```text
MIRBUILDER-BINDING-CONTEXT-ORDERED-MAP-PROBE-001
```

Purpose:

```text
Use OrderedMapBox in a focused BindingContext-style probe before any broad
MirBuilder rewrite.
```

```

Acceptance for the current slice:

```bash
git diff --check
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
# plus the focused probe smoke added by
# MIRBUILDER-BINDING-CONTEXT-ORDERED-MAP-PROBE-001
```

## Task Order

1. Add a focused BindingContext-style probe that uses OrderedMapBox.
2. Verify deterministic String-key iteration against a small expected output.
3. Do not rewrite MirBuilder or replace BindingContext in this row.
4. Keep `MapBox`, ring0, and ring1 provider registration unchanged.
5. Update `CURRENT_STATE.toml` when the implementation row closes.

Recommended next row:

```text
MIRBUILDER-BINDING-CONTEXT-ORDERED-MAP-PROBE-001
```
