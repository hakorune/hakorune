# CURRENT_TASK

Status: SSOT pointer
Date: 2026-06-20
Scope: root restart anchor only. Do not store landed history here.

## Quick Restart

1. Read `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
2. Read the `latest_card_path` named in `CURRENT_STATE.toml`.
3. Check the worktree:

```bash
git status -sb
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
```

4. Run heavier gates only when the current code slice is ready:

```bash
tools/checks/dev_gate.sh quick
```

## Current Task

Read these fields in `docs/development/current/main/CURRENT_STATE.toml`:

- `active_lane`
- `active_phase`
- `latest_card_path`
- `current_blocker_token`

Current blocker:

```text
RUST-SUBSET-CRATE-WRAPPER-EXE-SMOKE-001
```

Purpose:

```text
Pin the crate-wrapper EXE route as a stable app-front smoke after 296x-1333
unblocked the route and 296x-1334 hardened unsupported-shape diagnostics.
```

Acceptance for the current slice:

```bash
cargo check -q --lib
git diff --check
bash tools/checks/current_state_pointer_guard.sh
# plus a focused crate-wrapper EXE diagnostic command selected by the new row.
# plus the focused crate-wrapper EXE smoke selected by the new row.
```

## Task Order

1. Add a focused smoke/check for the three existing crate-wrapper entrypoints.
2. Verify `--emit-exe` success for the wrappers only.
3. Keep converter core, Rust parser ownership, crate graph discovery, and
   `json_native` source out of the smoke.
4. Do not claim generated `.hako` programs are executable applications.
5. Keep route selection unchanged.
6. Do not reopen fastpath or constructor lifecycle work without a new blocker.

Recommended next row:

```text
RUST-SUBSET-CRATE-WRAPPER-EXE-SMOKE-001
```

The shared crate wrappers pass EXE after 296x-1333, and 296x-1334 makes future
pure-route unsupported-shape blockers easier to diagnose. The next row should
pin wrapper EXE success as a stable smoke before moving to another crate or
source-shape pilot.
